# developer_test
This is my project based on the developer test that was sent.
I wanted to get something to you quickly and effectively, given the situation with the keys.
As I wasnt sure if use of a framework like Bootstrap would have been accepted,
I chose to put together a simple mock of a web page with limited interactions.
I do notice there are some things that I could clean up and would be happy to spend more time on it
if you'd like to see a more comple product.

Thank you for your time and consideration
